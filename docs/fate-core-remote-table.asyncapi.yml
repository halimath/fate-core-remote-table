  description: |
    Websocket based async API for the Fate Core Remote Table service.

    The overall communication architecture uses a CQRS-based approach. Clients request changes to the table's
    state by sending a command. Updates are carried out by the backed service which will notifiy all 
    respective users by sending an update message containing the full table state.

    Every user must generate a UUIDv4 to identify herself and send this UUID when connecting to the websocket 
    endpoint.
