  version: '1.0.0'
  description: |
    Websocket based async API for the Fate Core Remote Table service.

    The overall communication architecture uses a CQRS-based approach. Clients request changes to the table's
    state by sending a command. Updates are carried out by the backend service which will notifiy all 
    respective users by sending an update message containing the full table state. In addition, errors may
    be sent to specific clients when requests are rejected.

    Every user is assigned a unique identifier which must be used to select whether the user is the game
    master or a player.
